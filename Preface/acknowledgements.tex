\begin{acknowledgement}

The present work was carried out at Music and Machine Learning Department of the Music Technology Group at Universitat Pompeu Fabra, Barcelona, Spain.

First of all, I want to thank the supervisor of this thesis Sergio Giraldo, whose previous work, advise and ideas have been fundamentals to this project.

Secondly, I want to thank all the new friends that I've met during this whole master year. It's always nice to meet really different people but with the same interests than you from who you can learn a lot of things.

Last  but  not  least, I  am  very grateful to  my  family for their unconditional support and encouragement over these years. Many thanks.

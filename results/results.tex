\chapter{Results}
\label{chap:results}
In this chapter we are going to present the obtained results using the previous models, both from a quantitative point of view, by measuring correlation coefficient over predicted data and from a qualitative point of view, by surveying a few listeners with predicted and real performance samples . Firstly, in section~\ref{sec:features} we are going to apply feature selection in order to see what features are more relevant in order to obtain better prediction for performance actions. In section~\ref{sec:ev_measures} we are going to explain what measures are we going to consider for both results analysis. Finally in section~\ref{sec:ev_results} we present separately the results from both evalutaions.

\chapter{Methodology}
\label{chap:methods}
Four separate stages of this thesis can be defined: data acquisition (guitar recording), transcription, feature extraction and models computation. Expressive hexaphonic guitar recordings will be done using the Roland GK-3 divided pick-up, which is able to separate sound from each string~\cite{Angulo2016}. The main output of this first stage will be a new dataset consisting of hexaphonic recordings recorded by a professional guitar player with different performance actions of the performance depending on a given mood. \\
After this step, transcription of each individual string will be computed applying non-negative matrix factorization~\cite{OGrady2009}. After doing a score alignment with the original score and the transcription of the expressive guitar performance, feature extraction needs to be done.\\
Feature extraction will be performed following an approach in which each note is characterized by its \textit{nominal}, \textit{neighbouring}, and \textit{contextual} properties.  Here is where the most of the research in this thesis will take place:  checking for literature in expressive piano modelling, combining it with previously mentioned features of monophonic expressive guitar modelling,... \\
Several machine learning algorithms - i.e. \textit{artificial neural networks} (ANNs), \textit{decision trees} (DTs), \textit{support vector machines} (SVMs), \textit{k-nearest neighbours} (k-NN) - will be applied to predict those performance actions (timing, pitch, energy,...) and ornaments introduced by the musician when performing a musical piece
